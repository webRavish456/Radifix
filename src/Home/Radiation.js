Our lives are guided by several devices including TVs, inverters, microwave ovens, power distribution equipment, electric shavers to a wide range of wireless WiFi-enabled gadgets. According to a study by the Biological Institute of Germany, most Indian homes stand at a higher risk of electromagnetic radiation. This is further compounded by the advent of the IoT revolution that focuses on 24*7 connectivity.</p><p>Symptoms like headaches, sleep disturbances, chronic fatigue, to ailments like cardiovascular problems, fertility problems can be attributed to exposure to high levels of microwave radiation. Pregnant women and children are at especially higher risk.</p><p>At LiveSAFEâ„¢, we are committed to minimise your exposure to destructive electromagnetic radiation and help you lead a healthy and happy life.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p></div>
